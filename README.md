ChatTube transforms your interaction with YouTube videos. It's not just about watching videos anymore â€“ now you can extract transcripts, get summaries, interact with a cloned voice of the speaker, and much more.

## Description

ChatTube built on Azure features to enhance your learning and interaction with YouTube content:

- **Video Transcript Extraction**: Provide any YouTube video link, and the app will extract the transcript for you.
- **Transcript Summarization**: Get the gist of the video with an automated summary of the transcript.
- **Vector Store for Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Sets up a sophisticated vector store to augment content generation.
- **Voice Cloning**: Clone the voice of the video's speaker from the audio track.
- **Interactive Chat**: Engage in a simulated conversation with the cloned voice of the speaker, receiving text responses or listening to voice clones.
