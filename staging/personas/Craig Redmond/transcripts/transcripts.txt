update on nonprofit organizations issues and leaders I'm your host Mark oppenheim today we're talking with Craig Redmond of relief International about the work that relief International does around the world working I think Craig in 16 countries it's just so wonderful to have you here and relief International does such important work at this time of conflict could you just give us a sense of how you were founded but also I mean you're running in you're First Responders you're running into the line your people are putting their lives in danger they're trying to keep themselves safe they're trying to keep the people they serve safe but they are running into the fire uh talk about the idea the humanity behind that idea sacrificing yourself potentially for the sake of someone else yeah thank you Mark first of all what a pleasure to be with you really look forward to this conversation and thanks so much for having me and this for this opportunity to talk about relief International yeah we are um basically an alliance of four organizations you have relief International Incorporated relief International France UK and Europe which allows us really to Source income from multiple different donors you know around the world um so that's kind of structurally that's how we work I'm the CEO of all four of those uh entities um and then we have a single leadership team that oversees all of that so it's not a distinct organization it's not a it it's not a Federated model in that sense we're one organization that has that combination of four four entities there um you know I love your question about what it means at this time in the history I I'll tell you it's hard to picture a time that was with more upheaval than than right now um you know and I say to our teams all the time I can't imagine a more important time for Relief International to exist you know our whole mission is we we we work in as you say 16 countries um some of the toughest countries in the world and we partner with communities who are experiencing the impacts of conflict and climate change and disaster you know to build greater resilience uh and to have better health and well-being outcomes that's why we exist we which means uh we have to be ready to go into those places where things are very hot things are very dangerous very kinetic um and our teams are trained to do that and that's why we exist so you know for us the question is when an event happens whether it be in you know in Afghanistan or Sudan or Pakistan or Myanmar the question isn't sometimes should we it's rather why wouldn't we be there so in terms of the background of people who cut who run into the fire you know I I I imagine that we all think of ourselves as fairly capable individuals but if there's a burning building you don't want me running into the fire because I probably won't do any good I'd get in the way and I might kill myself how do you how do you um select people um what is their what are their background that equips them to walk into a situation and know whether they are uh in a serious um uh situation of danger or a serious situation of negotiation or a serious situation in which they can organize resource you know all of these things are serious but having the the sense to understand how to respond in a particular circumstance is so important I wouldn't have it how who who are your your folks men and women yeah that's a great question uh this is a really interesting distinction uh of relief International 98% of us are from the countries where we work so we're a very national team 98% so we're 7,000 people strong 98% of those are are National officers which means they come with language skills they come with contextual deep contextual understanding they come with an understanding of how to negotiate with government how to work with Community leaders you know they understand the Dynamics of what's happening and what's likely to happen in a way that you and I as as Outsiders never would so that's a starting place for that you know what does it take to be a first responder and what does it take to be impactful um in that event um but second Mark we do a pretty robust recruiting process training process to make sure that we have the right people and then once those team members are on board that training goes on um to make sure that number one they are in terms of the technical emergency response capacity they have that but also the basic code of conduct kinds of things to make sure that they're acting in ethical ways and so forth um that they're the right people so we take that process very seriously and then once we have people on the relief international team you know what it's like I mean you're in this business as well it having the right people and keeping the right people is more important than anything you can have if you have good leaders uh you can take a pretty weak strategy and make it work right it's good leaders throughout the organization right when you're talking about good leaders you're not talking about you and your direct reports you're talking about people on the ground in Sudan or in the the the border between Syria and Turkey right I'm talking about ex exactly right I'm talking about I'm talking about those people who interact with community members themselves all the way from our drivers to our people who are directly interacting with Community leaders sometimes in the worst times of their lives right after a dramatic event has happened as you you referenc the the earthquake in Turkey Syria the the the recent conflict in in Sudan you know uh uh all of these things you have to have people who are empathetic and deeply skilled in order to do this kind of work and then lattering you know l ing up to more senior leaders our country directors our regional directors and then the senior leadership team these are people that I I have to say I I deeply admire and I feel honored to be working with I want to come back to um to some of the issues that you raised but I but let's still follow this thread of ensuring that your your people as they conduct their work are conducting themselves with integrity and that um there isn't resource capture and so on you said that you have a very strong um interview regimen in terms of selecting and so on but there's also the whole question of audits right the most honest person when my family is in need is tempted um how do you ensure that you audit your your folks so that that temptation is also uh caught if people succumb to it yeah well we have several things in play here um and number one we have a pretty robust partner vetting process so that not only our own our own team but because we partner so closely with community and local organizations that we're vetting those organizations uh very carefully and then making sure that we put them through a code of conduct training to make sure that we are on the same page in terms of behaviors and professional ethics and um we have prohibited parties policies that we go through with each team and then in some cases an enhanced due diligence process that each team goes through each organization is put through to make sure that we know who we're working with closely both individuals and organizations um and that we feel confident in moving forward um with them as as partners so that's really an important part of of what we do to bring people on board and then Mark trying to cultivate this culture of making sure that we we have a speakup culture so so if you see something that isn't right or or you're ask something that isn't appropriate from an ethical perspective you know you feel comfortable saying something about that and you know where to go and so we have a whole whistleblowers mechanism to make sure that um people understand who they call what they you know how they reach out to the organization uh to to make sure that their concerns are are heard and then they'll be protected right so they if they're a whistleblower they actually are treated as someone who is serious and whose identities need to be kept yeah and then and then when it comes to auditing we have an internal audit team uh so we have our whole internal every country program is audited um and we send the team out there to do a full audit um and that the findings that come out of that audit we take action on and we report that directly to the board so we have an audit and risk committee on our board that closely follows uh uh the the audits themselves and the findings and you know um degree to which we're responding to those findings so that system is pretty robust and it has to be today because you know this is these are these are challenging times and to make sure that we're operating in an ethical and appropriate way every time is critical for us to have the impact we want to have so very important and you have about 7,000 people on staff and then you have have a network of Partners as well who are on the ground who are not part of your your group but collaborate with it right exactly exactly I I'll give you an example um you know right after the earthquake in Turkey Syria uh I was there to meet our team um that was an unbelievable time because as you know um in turkey and Syria the First Responders are also survivors so we have stories of team members who um escaped buildings as they were collapsing uh made it through the night and the next morning started responding immediately getting their their family to safety and they became responders themselves right away and that also is true of our of our partners um we work with um a local organization in turkus Syrian organization that builds Prosthetics um for people who have lost limbs as a result of the conflict or the earthquake itself you know these kind of organizations are so essential to who we do and that Pride that we have of being such a National Organization is also extended Mark to those those local partners that we have as well there's nothing like being able to multiply your impact by working with really really strong local Partners talk about the the cultural aspects that help your people your group to remain steady in service to human beings in situations where people um are enemies you know if I look for example you sided this the Syria uh turkey uh uh border uh and that earthquake well you have um uh both turkey and Syria um uh um viewing uh some Kurds as the enemy um you had both sides affected both sides of that international border the various uh Turkish turkic and and Kurdish people affected it's so easy to start to tilt Aid that comes in when when it when it hits the ground to toward your favored group right how do you ensure that people stay centered in serving human beings regardless as to whe you know where they're coming from in terms of the the political side or or some of the conflict side yeah that's really an important an important question and something that we talk about a lot as an organization and our sector generally we're really animated by the humanitarian principles and those four are so essential and they guiding principles for everything we do number one is this Humanity we're humanitarians where there's human suffering that's where we go that that's our mission so that that one is really so incred incredibly important the second is neutrality you know as you say um we are a neutral organization we don't take political sides um we we don't choose camps um you know we go where we're needed and we work on humanitarian issues so staying neut is essential not only to being impactful but being safe U and then the third one is is impartial we're impartial towards who the people who need the support are the people who get it and finally Independence you know we don't we're a non-governmental organization uh and that means that we're not aligned to any one government uh we're an independent entity we're allowed you know according to uh we're sign you know our governments are signatories to um instruments that that say it's important that we remain independent in order in order for us to go into places and to have the kind of impact we have so those humanitarian principles are really The Guiding lights for us um as we navigate the complexity of some of the places that we're discussing are the four principles part of the reason for your Incorporated structure so that you're not um captured by the Incorporated laws um of any one country that you can basically retain your neutral um but still serve and still be be allied with uh country organizations country funding that serves this purpose of of humanitarian support it's interesting you ask that it you the humanitarian principles are ones that we bring up and talk about with our own board and with our senior leadership team you know all all the time every once in a while there is a request for applications um that in certain context feels doesn't feel right uh and we have that conversation is that a piece of work that we would want to do is that appropriate in this context you know no it is not um therefore we we wouldn't do that so you know these these are not some conceptual ideas that are that are that are you know set aside somewhere their living principles that we um you know that we struggle with and we work with and we Define for ourselves all all the time and we apply them to this very Dynamic context in which we work so that's an important question and having these different entities allows us to work with different kinds of donors um in different kinds of contexts gives us that flexibility a little bit so the interplay between the principles our alliance structure and who we are as a single organization is a constant push poll that's very interesting um I have a question about the hottest of of of conflict zones whether it's Sudan or whether it's the Palestinian territory in the Gaza Strip um you you've got this this situation in which you have Waring factions U mixed amongst people and you're you're trying to serve provide the humanitarian service to to uh to people who are affected how do you how do you operate within such a hot environment um where you know you know for there's no question that some of your Aid ends up supporting the conflict because people are interspersed amongst you know the the the people who are driving conflict are in dispersed among amongst the population how do you keep yourself safe in that environment how do you ensure that you're having your humanitarian impact or does it not matter matter whether somebody is trying to kill each other as long as they have a need do you do you supply it how do you how do you make those distinctions yeah almost impossible yeah well I'll I I think the best way to unpack that one is to give you an example um in March uh a year ago uh I was in um Sudan um and this was only a couple of weeks before the conflict started the conflict again started in April of last year I was there in March right before I was in uh North darur where a lot of the conflict is really raging um and I was visiting our Primary Health Care Centers there relief International has a network of about 40 Primary Health Care Facilities that we run these are those essential first stop places where if someone is injured or hurt or a mom is having a baby or you know those kinds of level of of needs that's where they go and for us as an organization those Primary Health Care Centers are for us philosophically the basis and and the starting point for any kind of long-term Community resilience we think those centers are a precondition for a community to have real resilience so we we we take that work very seriously and about 70% of what we do is in that Primary Health Care space so I was at this clinic in North Dar and and I really saw how essentially important that was to all the community members we have a water and sanitation point there there's a there's a solar powered a water point where people can get water that's where they get nutritional information when there are any food distributions that's where it happens it's really this Center Point uh you know for all of that kind of community community work and then the conflict happens and most International organizations were uh forced to close down their operations and leave uh the country but we did not that clinic that I just described to you stayed operational in North darur even just a couple of days were we forced to uh close down and go to ground why is that because those clinics are run by Sudanese professionals who understand the context they know how to navigate the context they know when things are really hot um this is when we need to shut the doors and go to our our relatives in you know two Villages over uh to avoid the conflict until it's safe to do so then they come back uh and they reopen so we were able to stay open and provide services to community members who desperately need them uh in in the context of something as dynamic as that as that crisis in Sudan elsewhere in Sudan with the other clinics um some of them have had to turn into Mobile clinics so as Community communities are themselves on the run or they're displaced our mobile clinics are able to move along with them and provide services along the way so Mark it's a matter of us being very flexible and being um really responsive to changing Dynamics on the ground and our team members and our leaders because they're National because they understand the situation so well are able to say we need to Pivot here and we need to Pivot in this way at this time uh and we follow their lead I'm gonna ask a a uh even more um fraud question um in these in these situations people are coming into your facilities shot up and they could be shot up from either side and so you must face and your people must face circumstances where in one bed you're treating somebody who has been trying to kill the the person in the other bed how does how do you deal with that I mean are you are you just basically saying at that moment that person is shut up we will treat them and the war stops at our door yeah you you know that that situation um you know can happen um it's not a as as common as you as you would think um for the most part military they have their own system of treating of treating people you know we just we just don't see huge numbers of soldiers coming in for treatment you know in in our facilities ours really our designed to serve the needs of community members themselves um they know this is about them uh they're they're staffed by people from those communities and so that that that's what they're for so it's really not as much as an issue as as you would imagine but it is a neutral place it's the the actual facility is is accepted is that a prec precondition that you feel that you are accepted by the various people in Conflict zones as a neutral place that is important where where respect for your values even as even as people are are are trying to harm others right yep respect for your values is a certain modum of that because if there isn't then you just become a Target yourselves that's a really important point and in fact that whole concept of community acceptance is the centerpiece of our security protocol basically Community acceptance says if the community knows who we are they know what we're doing and they value and need and want what we're doing they will keep us safe so we don't have armed guards at our facilities we don't travel with armed guards we don't have you know we don't have any of that what we have is community acceptance and and that keeps us safe I myself have seen a situation in which um years ago I was in Afghanistan and our plan was to go to Village X you know 20 50 om up the road and right before we left we got a we got a call from a community leader who said no not a good day to come uh let's change our plans go somewhere else I'll let you know when it's safe to come and three days later they said you can come now no problem so that's an example of what community acceptance looks and acts like in practice and without it there's no way we could be impactful or or safe for that matter so that's such an essential essential tool that underpins everything we everywhere in the world thank you so much for the explanation we're coming to the end of our time but I'd like to go over uh two more issues uh the first being uh this idea of how you put together uh this team across linguistic uh racial cultural lines in a way where power is actually shared and not dictated and where there is mutual respect it's inevitable that people coming from um uh uh countries that are generally funding C uh uh countries um that that uh those people end up doing things like fundraising right um they might also if if they're from the incorporate the for Incorporated entities they might you might have finance and tax and other people who are technical experts within those country environments and then you have the the various countries in which you serve and you have different types of experts talk about how you build a management team to deal with not only the the objective technical sides but also the human relations uh sides and ensure that we don't end up with some sort of a top-down neoc colonialist kind of a a structure here both at the board and on the staff level um where there is the ability to have these organizations evolve very flexibly Bas in the talent of our people I love that question mark because that really that really gets to the heart of what we do as nonprofit leaders it doesn't it so for me it comes down to a few things first of all diversity is a superpower you know it's not it's not political correctness it's not it is a superpower for any organization because all the research shows a diverse group of people comes up with a higher quality level of decision making than a monolithic group sort of like a syncratic method right syncratic method is all about one person challenging another person because they come from a different point of view they come from a different experience what you're basically saying is that this idea of diversity it isn't about skin color right it's about thinking and it's about heart it's about experience absolutely it's a the kind of diversity that you know my my lived experience is different from yours and and and my skin color is different than yours and but where I grew up is different and and the way I see problems and solutions is different and so making sure that we have that diverse group of people around the table when we tackle huge complex not complicated but complex issues is absolutely essential that that's number one so do we have that right mix of in you know A diversity of opinions uh around the table that's that's number one and two um do we have crisp well articulated strategic uh understanding of what we're trying to achieve as a as a team making sure that that uh real clear articulation of mission and a shared understanding of what that is is absolutely essential right if in our brains and in our hearts we're aligned and you think about the problem differently than I do but essentially we're trying to solve the same problem suddenly something really powerful can happen and then Mark third I would just say uh you know culturally making sure that we've established this culture in which you know we we talked about the speak speak up culture making sure there that that you and I have um a kind of relation between us where where I can respectfully disagree with you or say I think you're not seeing this in the right way so if you have the diversity you have C iic Clarity and you have that culture in which you can have good old good oldfashioned debate you can end up in a very much higher place and you ever could otherwise so the the final question I have really is related to this this question it's really about communication and it has so many different aspects so in in terms of of cultural attributes things that we learn from our families and so on there are certain cultures where being verbally uh penetrating um is is lauded and for some it's viewed as being in your face and offensive right how you look people in the eye or not can be both sides can be interpreted both sides there can be uh gender distinctions there there are gender distinctions in all societies there are preconceptions in all societies and the the the challenge for communication is that management teams can become kind of disconnected you've kind of already given us a hint by your stories of your travels to Frontline areas of of part of how you personally deal with that you put yourself into the environment and allow yourself to be informed and corrected right by the environment in which you are but how do you deal with these very fine distinctions because when we're serving clients sometimes we'll have a candidate who is fantastic but they're they commity communication style gives the board the impression oh they're not they're not charismatic enough or they're not this or they're not that which is really a definition that comes from the board's own background right it's not it's not revealed wisdom it's just that's how they they see it it doesn't and we you know how do you how do you deal with that because you're dealing with so many different people yeah so many different perspectives yeah yeah well I I think it's it's a wonderful question and we could you and I could I would love to do that sometime talk for hours on that subject alone you know the fact is as a team you have to create space for the differences between us and how we see the world and how we communicate um sometimes we need to wait longer for one another to get to a conclusion some people as you know are are just good talkers and some people are good thinkers but they need they want to write you know so for really important top issues and challeng that we as an organization take on we'll offer them up and say hey we want to take this we want to take on this issue next week come ready to talk about that giving people an opportunity to really think it through whether they need to do a little bit of research or they want to do some writing on their own or they just want to think and talk off the cuff you know again offering that opportunity for diversity of thought and diversity of approaches to really emerge and Bloom in that conversation is what we're trying to do I'm not saying that we get it right every time uh and sometimes things are moving so fast I do worry uh that we're some leaving some some perspectives behind you know but um making sure that we create that space uh and and are respectful of the differences between people whether they be you know uh the extroverts who love to hear themselves think out loud or introverts uh uh who are you know people who really want to write and think and are very thoughtful in that deep sort of quieter way man we need all of it we need all of it at the table if we're going to get this work right this is the irony and the truth of the situation right you can't get it right because there is no right there is no correct answer right but you can try to get it right yes knowing that it's impossible try fail because you will fail because there is no one right but try again and try again and try again it's so important to everything that you do this whole idea of getting it right getting it right by people within conflict zones or disaster zones or or just in places where people are in need trying to get it right for your own folks trying to keep everyone safe it's been just a great pleasure Craig Raymond relief International thank you thank you thank you so much for the work that you do thank you for sharing it with us please thank your people please thank you please thank your communities please thank your partners it is it is just an honor to have this time with you today oh the pleasure is mine mark thank you so much for having me it's great talking with [Music] you e"}, {"keyword": "Craig Redmond", "text": "foreign good afternoon relief International my name is Craig and I'm this new CEO for Relief International it's such a pleasure to be with you today as you can see I'm talking to you from beautiful beautiful London it's such a pleasure to be here with the team talking about where we want to go as an organization and celebrating where we've been I want to take a few minutes to talk to you about some of the Big Ideas we have coming up very soon but first I want to say a huge thank you to all of you for all the incredible work that you do day in and day out the work that you do on the ground with the people we serve around the world in achieving Mission it's so important and I want you to know how much we all appreciate the work that you do so thank you next I want to say a few things about the four areas that we're looking at so that we can continue to improve as an organization and bring even more services and more impact to the places we serve the first of those areas is strategy as you all know strategy is one of the most important things an organization can do well we have an interesting strategic framework right now as an organization but we can do a lot more with that we can build it out we can make sure that we represent that strategy in a way that all of you can see yourselves and you can see the areas where we can improve and where we're headed as an organization so focusing on strategy and making sure it's one that really represents where we need to go as an organization and IT addresses what the world is calling upon us to do as an organization so strategy is number one number two along with that is fundraising I'm sure you can all appreciate the fact that we know we want to raise even more money so that we can bring even greater impact to the communities we serve in all the places where you live and work and we're going to do that we're going to focus on telling our story in really compelling ways to Major donors as well as small donors and individuals and so we can diversify those funding streams so we have more flexibility to solve the kinds of problems that all of you see every day I'm really excited about the possibility of being even a stronger fundraiser out in the world that's number two number three is attracting and keeping unbelievable world-class Talent like all of you we want to make sure that we're an organization that attracts people who want to do exciting work who want to do the best work of their lives and want to contribute substantially to the the incredible important work that organization like relief International does every day so attracting and keeping amazing people is priority number three at number four is communication what we want to do on a regular basis is make sure that we're talking to each other we're telling the stories we're talking about the impact we're having we're learning and growing as an organization and that comes when we're able to really fluently speak to one another from around the world we're going to look at systems for making sure that we can do this in a way that is easy that's quick it doesn't have to be polished but the point is what's happening what am I excited about what did I learn today and I want my colleagues from around the world to know too that's internal communication and then externally make sure that we're even increasing the way that we tell our story so that our donors and supporters and others even colleague agencies see what we're doing and can learn from that and talk about what we do those are four major priority areas that we want to be focusing on in the next few months and years I can't tell you how happy I am to be with all of you I'm proud and humbled to have joined this organization and I can't I can't wait to meet you all and to see the work that you do and engage with all of you very very soon thank you so much for your time and I'll see you soon take care"}]
